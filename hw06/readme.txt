         I followed the steps in derek molley's tutorial to configure P9_42 to be an input pin, with a pull-up resistor by using a device tree overlay.
         I have made the device tree as was instructed. The htop was'nt getting installed in accordance with the instructions. The error message "Unable to locate package Htop" showed up.
