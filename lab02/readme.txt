          In this lab we controlled Leds using pushbutton switches.
          
          a)for blinking 2 leds when switch is pressed ,inp_2.js has the code 
          b)for blinking an led 10 times when a pushbutton is pressed, file inp_3.js as developed.
          c)we then used 2 pushbutton switches, one for turning on the led and another for turning it off. The code is in inp_4.js
