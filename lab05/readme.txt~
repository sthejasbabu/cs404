This lab is  to connect ultrasonic sensor(hc-sr04)to beaglebone hc-sr04-ultraSonic.js contains code for using ultrasonic sensor to sense obstacle and  print distance  in cm.
Ultrasonic sensor Reading (in cm)                       Actual Distance ( in cm)

       From the readings we can see that there is always some error in the measurement of the distance. We can see that the error increases with increase in distance, but the percentage of error decreases.
	
	The ultrasonic sensor has two cylinder like objects attached to them. One sends the wave while the other recieves the reflected wave. When Input is given to the trigger pin, a wave is sent and when the wave is recieved back, the echo pin is given logic 1 and input is given to the Beaglebone.Based on time difference, hte distance is calculated.
	
	This lab gave a broad overview of range sensors and their applications and working. But based on the errors obtained, it seems a bit unreliable.
