d)The input signal is given to the trigger pin and then a wave is sent.when the wave is recieved back, the echo pin sends a signal to the Beaglebone.the distance is calculated based on the difference in time between these two events.

e) The error in the readings increases with increase in distance, however the percentage of error decreases.
