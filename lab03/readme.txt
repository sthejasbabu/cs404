a)we read the input values i.e [analog voltage] of the variable resistor and printed it in run time using read_pot.js

b)Using the pulse width modulation pins on the beagle bone, we altered the brightness of the Leds using analog.js code.

c)we worked with 2 Leds, while increasing the brightness of 1 Led we decreased the brightness of the other Led using the code written in fade.js.

d) The slider.js program is used to change the brightness of the Leds using the input from variable resistor.

e)In  classroom , we opened the JS Fiddle webpage and connected our beagle bone to the site and displayed the readings of the bone on the web page.
